I builded these packages because they are not in debian 12 repository. 

x64,i386 & armhf packages provided.  
  
# installation:  
  
download appropriate package, and do (for example for 32bits package):  
  
```
sudo apt install ./spotify_player-0.18.2_i386.deb
```
(or install with graphical .deb installer if you have one, for example QSI installer for q4os: left click the .deb, then 'open with' and choose QSI installer)  
  
The package takes care of creating the corresponding '.desktop' entry (so you will have access to spotify-player from your applications menu).
